            <h2>22nd of June <span>Week 1</span></h2>
            <p>Being the first entry into this journal, I think it would be sensible to briefly expand on the point of
                these entries. In the past I have found it useful to relfect on how my work has gone in a journal 
                every week, but rather than just listing the happenings of that week, it was much more beneficial
                to <em>reflect</em> on what was happening and draw out ways I could improve. As well as providing ways to improve
                my work, I am also provided with another layer of accountability- which I know has always improved my work peformance.<br><br>
                This week I had attended an evening meeting with a group of fellow budding software developers, which I have been attending for a 
                few weeks now- being a part of this group is extremely valuable as I may be able to collaborate and partner with some of the members
                of this group for larger projects I may need to work on, and may also be able to leverage some of their expertise when needed. <br>
                My personal work revolved around HTML and CSS this past week, that consisted of me picking up lots of skills regarding the structure and layout of websites
                and web apps; lots of this knowlodge is fresh and I have been considering approaching some local businesses and offer to build them a site in order to consolidate my knowlodge
                and build my portfolio- Although I may need to accumalate more wesbite design knowlodge before doing this. <br>
                I have also networked in person with the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobherandi/#" target='_blank'>co-founder</a> of a new software startup. His company recently recieved 
                new funding from investors and we discussed how his businesses is looking for developers to push his app to market. We agreed to keep in touch to see if
                I can assist with any development in the future. This has really highlighted to me the value of networking- going from this, I will dedicate some time next week to updating my 
                proffesional profiles (i.e LinkedIn). I may also consider creating a portfolio website for myself: where potential employers or clients may view may work.<br><br>
                One final note for this week: I thrive under accountability and specifically <em>pressure</em>. After my meeting with Densie this week, I have found that my motivation has been seriously bolstered, I'm excited 
                for this level of energy to continue as I learn and grow as a developer, and grow my own business, and for that I am very thankful for.

            <h2>1st of July <span>Week 2</span></h2>
            <p>
                This last week there has been a big focus on networking, as a result of the success of the networking activities of the prior.
                I remotely the <a href="https://deploy.digitalocean.com/home" target="_blank">Deploy- Power your business</a> seminar. There was an oppurtunuity for online networking on a group forum, 
                however this was nowhere near as effective as my one-to-one the week prior. Despite this the seminar still provided very beneficial information in the seminars, such as <em>growth strategies for startups</em> or 
                <em>Social Media Marketing for Organic Engagement</em>. This seminar was expecptionally useful as it provided primarily advice tagretted at those with business models similar to the one I wish to develop (Saas).
                This expereince has also taught me something about the way I develop proffesionally: being thrown into the deep end of proffesional situations that I may not be comfortable in, results in <strong>rapid proffesional skill growth</strong> .
                I had also spent some time updating and improving some elements of my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/laith-a-a158b9124/" target="_blank">LinkenIn profile</a> (as mentioned the previous week) so that I can leverage this tool better when networking.
                <br>During a discussion during my weekly evening software developer meeting, the importance of a well maintained and polished <a href="https://github.com/laith8910">GitHub account</a> is for employers and other developers you may be working with.
                Following this discussion I will be ensuring that my work is well documented on the GitHub platform to ensure that I appear proffesional to any interested persons.
                <br><br>
                When working under time scales or any under external pressure, my mind looks to ways to achieve <strong>as much as possible</strong> in as little time.
                One way I have found to achieve this is time chunking with pomodoro timing. This means that I set goals for myself for each segment of time that I must complete within that time.
                This first achieves the effect of accountability for the work I complete, and also achieves the impact of gratification for when I achieve these goals, which helps with further motivation.
                I think to expand the scope of this so far successful technique, I would like to set daily, weekly and monthly goals for myself, and hold myself to account for these.
